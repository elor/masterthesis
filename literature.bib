This classic computational geometry problem is studied from the point of view of the efficiency, extendibility to any dimensionality, and ease of implementation. A new solution to {DT} is proposed, based on an original interpretation of the well-known Divide and Conquer paradigm. One of the main characteristics of this new algorithm is its generality: it can be simply extended to triangulate point sets in any dimension. The technique adopted is very efficient and presents a subquadratic behaviour in real applications in E3, although its computational complexity does not improve the theoretical bounds reported in the literature. An evaluation of the performance on a number of datasets is reported, together with a comparison with other {DT} algorithms.},

Nondefective models include clusters representing the site above a fully coordinated surface Si atom and bridging O atoms, and the defective models include clusters representing an under-coordinated Si defect, a nonbridging O defect, and a ring structure. Energies were obtained for the approach of atomic and molecular oxygen to these clusters in various configurations by using explicitly correlated {CCSD}(T)-F12b electronic structure theory and the Minnesota density functionals, which were found to be in good agreement. The Minnesota functionals were employed in binding energy calculations for all of the clusters, considering the singlet and triplet spin states for nondefective clusters and doublet and quartet spin states for defective clusters. We find that the chosen defects are energetically favorable sites for binding. The density functional energies were used to extend the empirical {ReaxFFSiO} potential for silica, which was previously parametrized for bulk silica polymorphs (van Duin et al. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2003, 107, 3803?3811), to model the gas?surface interactions represented by the defective and nondefective clusters presented here. Interaction energy predictions from {ReaxFFSiOGSI} agree very well with the density functional energies. {ReaxFFSiOGSI} can now be employed in reactive large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving oxygen?silica gas?surface interactions such as oxide growth and the heterogeneous recombination of oxygen occurring on real silica surfaces.},

In this work, the {ReaxFF} forcefield was first expanded by training it with new quantum mechanics data of the binding energy, equation of state, and heat of formation of the {SiC} crystal, along with data from earlier studies that describes Si ? Si, Si ? O, and Si ? H interactions. This expanded {ReaxFF} forcefield is capable of simultaneously describing both Si?C?O and Si?O?H bonding interactions. Using the forcefield, oxidation simulations were performed at various temperatures (in the range of 500 to 5000 K), and the trajectories were analyzed. The analyses showed that {SiC} gradually transforms into the oxides of silicon with simultaneous formation of a graphite-like layer. In presence of excess O2, the graphite-like layer was further oxidized to {CO} and {CO}2. We also analyzed the trajectories with two-atom and three-atom clusters to quantitatively track the oxidation progress. This analysis clearly showed Si?O and C?C bond formation at the expense of O?O and Si?C bond consumption indicating {SiC} oxidation with simultaneous formation for carbon-like structure. Consumption of {SiC} with O2 was found to be faster than that with H2O. We have also reported the oxidation simulation of {SiC} with a mixture of H2O and O2. Oxidation proceeded effectively as a two-part sequence, with O2 first oxidizing the {SiC}, followed then by H2O.},

In agreement with experimental observation, these simulations predict that {TATB} decomposition quickly (by 30 ps) initiates the formation of large carbonaceous clusters (more than 4000 amu, or ?15?30\% of the total system mass), and {HMX} decomposition leads almost exclusively to small-molecule products. We find that {HMX} decomposes readily on this time scale at lower temperatures, for which the decomposition rate of {TATB} is about an order of magnitude slower. Analyzing the {ReaxFF} {MD} results leads to the detailed atomistic structure of this carbon-rich phase of {TATB} and allows characterization of the kinetics and chemistry related to this phase and their dependence on system density and temperature. The carbon-rich phase formed from {TATB} contains mainly polyaromatic rings with large oxygen content, leading to graphitic regions. We use these results to describe the initial reaction steps of thermal decomposition of {HMX} and {TATB} in terms of the rates for forming primary and secondary products, allowing comparison to experimentally derived models. These studies show that {MD} using the {ReaxFF} reactive force field provides detailed atomistic information that explains such macroscopic observations as the dramatic difference in carbon cluster formation between {TATB} and {HMX}. This shows that {ReaxFF} {MD} captures the fundamental differences in the mechanisms of such systems and illustrates how the {ReaxFF} may be applied to model complex chemical phenomena in energetic materials. The studies here illustrate this for modestly sized systems and modest periods; however, {ReaxFF} calculations of reactive processes have already been reported on systems with ?106 atoms. Thus, with suitable computational facilities, one can study the atomistic level chemical processes in complex systems under extreme conditions.},

	abstract = {To investigate the failure of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer ({PDMS}) at high temperatures and pressures and in the presence of various additives, we have expanded the {ReaxFF} reactive force field to describe carbonsilicon systems. From molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations using {ReaxFF} we find initial thermal decomposition products of {PDMS} to be {CH}3 radical and the associated polymer radical, indicating that decomposition and subsequent cross-linking of the polymer is initiated by {SiC} bond cleavage, in agreement with experimental observations. Secondary reactions involving these {CH}3 radicals lead primarily to formation of methane. We studied temperature and pressure dependence of {PDMS} decomposition by following the rate of production of methane in the {ReaxFF} {MD} simulations. We tracked the temperature dependency of the methane production to extract Arrhenius parameters for the failure modes of {PDMS}. Furthermore, we found that at increased pressures the rate of {PDMS} decomposition drops considerably, leading to the formation of fewer {CH}3 radicals and methane molecules. Finally, we studied the influence of various additives on {PDMS} stability. We found that the addition of water or a {SiO}2 slab has no direct effect on the short-term stability of {PDMS}, but addition of reactive species such as ozone leads to significantly lower {PDMS} decomposition temperature. The addition of nitrogen monoxide does not significantly alter the degradation temperature but does retard the initial production of methane and C2 hydrocarbons until the nitrogen monoxide is depleted. These results, and their good agreement with available experimental data, demonstrate that {ReaxFF} provides a useful computational tool for studying the chemical stability of polymers.},

	abstract = {The practical levels of density functional theory ({DFT}) for solids ({LDA}, {PBE}, {PW}91, B3LYP) are well-known not to account adequately for the London dispersion (van der Waals attraction) so important in molecular solids, leading to equilibrium volumes for molecular crystals ?10?15\% too high. The {ReaxFF} reactive force field is based on fitting such {DFT} calculations and suffers from the same problem. In the paper we extend {ReaxFF} by adding a London dispersion term with a form such that it has low gradients (lg) at valence distances leaving the already optimized valence interactions intact but behaves as 1/R6 for large distances. We derive here these lg corrections to {ReaxFF} based on the experimental crystal structure data for graphite, polyethylene ({PE}), carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and for energetic materials: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-s-triazine ({RDX}), pentaerythritol tetranitrate ({PETN}), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene ({TATB}), and nitromethane ({NM}). After this dispersion correction the average error of predicted equilibrium volumes decreases from 18.5 to 4.2\% for the above systems. We find that the calculated crystal structures and equation of state with {ReaxFF}-lg are in good agreement with experimental results. In particular, we examined the phase transition between α-{RDX} and ?-{RDX}, finding that {ReaxFF}-lg leads to excellent agreement for both the pressure and volume of this transition occurring at ?4.8 {GPa} and ?2.18 g/cm3 density from {ReaxFF}-lg vs 3.9 {GPa} and ?2.21 g/cm3 from experiment. We expect {ReaxFF}-lg to improve the descriptions of the phase diagrams for other energetic materials.},
