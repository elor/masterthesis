	abstract = {Undoped carbon nanotubefield-effect transistors ({CNTFETs}) with zero-Schottky-barrier contacts have the current-voltage response of field-effect transistors({FETs}), but the physics of their operation is that of voltage-controlled tunnel barriers. The carbon nanotube({CNT}) body itself provides the tunnel barrier. The leakage current in {CNTFETs} is a combination of both interband and intraband tunneling and this current can be significantly reduced by changing the {CNT} diameter as well as the {CNT} length and source/drain asymmetry. Source and drain extensions significantly reduce the leakage current and increase the {ON}/{OFF} current ratio. Asymmetry with the gate closer to the source further reduces leakage, improves the {ON}/{OFF} current ratio, decreases the switching time, and increases the cutoff frequency despite the higher gate capacitance. An {ON}/{OFF} current ratio of \&gt; 10 4 can be obtained from a 50 - nm -long, 1.5 - nm -diameter {CNT} with a 2 nm gate. The switching time is very small in the 0.1 ps range and the cutoff frequency is very high in the 4 {THz} range. Coulomb blockade is expected to block the interband resonant tunneling (ambipolar) leakage current so that the {CNTFETs} become effectively unipolar devices. Poisson’s equation is solved self-consistently with the nonequilibrium Green’s-function equations using a π -bond model for the {CNT}.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes ({CNTs}) are amongst the most explored one-dimensional nanostructures and have attracted tremendous interest from fundamental science and technological perspectives. Albeit topologically simple, they exhibit a rich variety of intriguing electronic properties, such as metallic and semiconducting behaviour. Furthermore, these structures are atomically precise, meaning that each carbon atom is still three-fold coordinated without any dangling bonds. {CNTs} have been used in many laboratories to build prototype nanodevices. These devices include metallic wires, field-effect transistors, electromechanical sensors and displays. They potentially form the basis of future all-carbon electronics.This review deals with the building blocks of understanding the device physics of {CNT}-based nanodevices. There are many features that make {CNTs} different from traditional materials, including chirality-dependent electronic properties, the one-dimensional nature of electrostatic screening and the presence of several direct bandgaps. Understanding these novel properties and their impact on devices is crucial in the development and evolution of {CNT} applications.},

Two methods for their conversion from p- to n-type devices are presented. The first method involves conventional doping with an electron donor, while the second consists of annealing the contacts in vacuum to remove adsorbed oxygen. A comparison of these methods shows fundamental differences in the mechanism of the transformation. The key finding is that the main effect of oxygen adsorption is not to dope the bulk of the tube, but to modify the barriers at the metal–semiconductor contacts. The oxygen concentration and the level of doping of the nanotube are therefore complementary in controlling the {CNTFET} characteristics. Finally, a method of controlling individually the contact barriers by local heating is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe the development of the Stanford University Carbon Nanotube {FET} ({CNFET}) Compact Model. The {CNFET} Model is a circuit-compatible, compact model which describes enhancement-mode, {CMOS}-like {CNFETs}. It can be used to simulate both functionality and performance of large-scale circuits with hundreds of {CNFETs}. To produce realistic and relevant results, the model accounts for several practical non-idealities such as scattering in the near-ballistic channel, effects of the source/drain extension region, and charge-screening for multiple-nanotube {CNFETs}. The model also includes a full transcapacitance network for more accurate transient and {AC} results. The Stanford University {CNFET} Model is implemented in both {HSPICE} macro language and {VerilogA}. The {VerilogA} implementation shows speedups of roughly 7x∼15x over {HSPICE}. Applications of the model suggest that n- and p-{CNFETs} will have 6x and 13x speed advantage over Si n- and p-{MOSFETs} respectively at the 32nm node, and that a {CNT} density of 250 {CNTs}/um is ideal for multiple-nanotube gates. Such a compact {CNFET} model will be absolutely essential in ushering in the Design Era of {CNFET} circuits as carbon nanotube technology outgrows its “science discovery” phase.},

	abstract = {We observe infrared laser excited photoconductivity from a single carbon nanotube incorporated as the channel of an ambipolar field-effect transistor ({FET}). Electron-hole pairs are generated within the nanotube molecule, and the carriers are separated by an applied electric field between the source and drain contacts. The photocurrent shows resonances whose energies are in agreement with the energies of exciton states of semiconducting nanotubes of the appropriate diameter.

The employed contact parameters allow for discontinuities of the effective mass at the metal-{CNT} interface, and carefully chosen boundary conditions minimize spurious reflections at the simulation domain boundaries. Two-port Y-parameters of a selected device structure are computed and qualitatively explained with the time dependence of coherent quantum-ballistic charge injection. The finite escape times of the charge carriers in an open quantum system are identified for determining the inertial response to high-frequency terminal signals.

In order to be compatible with both large-(digital) and small-signal (analog) applications, a complete transcapacitance network is implemented to deliver the real-time dynamic response.

In these devices, the source and drain contacts are realized with metal silicide, and the injection of carriers is controlled by gate voltage modulation of tunneling through the source barrier. A simple model treating the silicide regions as metals, coupled with an Airy function approach for tunneling through the barrier, provides injecting boundary conditions for the Monte Carlo procedure. Simulations were carried out considering a p-channel device with 270 Å gate length for which measurements are available. Our results show that in these structures there is not a strong interaction with the oxide interface as in conventional {MOS} devices and carriers are injected at fairly wide angles from the source into the bulk of the device. The Monte Carlo simulations not only give good agreement with current-voltage (I-V) curves, but also easily reproduce the subthreshold behavior since all the computational power is devoted to simulation of channel particles. The simulations also clarify why these structures exhibit a large amount of leakage in subthreshold regime, due to both thermionic and tunneling emission. Computational experiments suggest ways to modify the doping profile to reduce to some extent the leakage},

These energy barriers severely limit transistor conductance in the '{ON}' state, and reduce the current delivery capability—a key determinant of device performance. Here we show that contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes by palladium, a noble metal with high work function and good wetting interactions with nanotubes, greatly reduces or eliminates the barriers for transport through the valence band of nanotubes. In situ modification of the electrode work function by hydrogen is carried out to shed light on the nature of the contacts. With Pd contacts, the '{ON}' states of semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted ballistic metallic tubes, exhibiting room-temperature conductance near the ballistic transport limit of 4e2/h (refs 4–6), high current-carrying capability (25 A per tube), and Fabry–Perot interferences at low temperatures. Under high voltage operation, the current saturation appears to be set by backscattering of the charge carriers by optical phonons. High-performance ballistic nanotube field-effect transistors with zero or slightly negative Schottky barriers are thus realized.},

We also show that charge density on the nanowire is a sensitive function of the contact geometry. For a nanowire transistor with large gate underlaps, charge transferred from bulk electrodes can effectively "dope" the intrinsic, ungated region and allow the transistor to operate. Reducing the gate oxide thickness and the source/drain contact size decreases the length by which the source/drain electric field penetrates into the channel, thereby, improving the transistor characteristics.},

Electronic structure and the density of states functions have been utilized to derive analytical equations for the carrier concentration under high and low doping concentrations. The temperature dependence has also been investigated. The results show how varying diameters and wrapping angles of carbon nanotubes change their concentration profile. The implications of these results allow us to use the same material (carbon nanotube) for a wide range of applications only by varying the chiral vector (n,m). The calculations performed in this work set an upper limit for a wide range of applications including carbon nanotube interconnects and carbon nanotube field effect transistors.

The semiclassical simulation of transistors of gate length in the range 10-100 nm shows the strong ballisticity of the transport in the gated part of the channel, while the emission of high-energy phonons occurs only beyond the drain end of the channel. For a gate length of 25 nm, the fraction of ballistic electrons reaches 89\%, instead of typically 31\% in the silicon {FET} of the same gate length with the undoped channel. For a gate length higher than 20 nm, the main quantum-transport effect is the reflection of carriers due to the sharp potential drop at the drain end of the channel. In spite of strong microscopic differences observed when comparing Wigner and Boltzmann functions, this effect just makes the quantum current slightly smaller than the semiclassical one on the full range of the gate voltage. For a smaller gate length, the source-drain tunneling becomes possible in the subthreshold regime, which enhances the subthreshold slope and the off-current in the quantum simulation.},

As an example, for Si {CMOS} technology, industry-standard tools such as {PISCES} [2] and {SPICE} [3] are essential for device design and circuit simulation, respectively. Higher level abstraction tools [4] are used to describe and synthesize circuits at the system level.In this chapter, we describe the development of a device-level model [5] that can be used as a rapid device design space exploration tool (an independent and parallel effort on {SWNT}-{FET} modeling can be found in [6]).

A mode space approach can be used to reduce the computational cost of atomistic simulations for the strained {CNTs} by orders of magnitude. It is shown that even a small amount of uniaxial ({\textless} 2\%) or torsional ({\textless}5deg) strain can result in a large effect on the performance of the {CNTFETs} due to the variation of the band gap and band-structure-limited velocity. Semiconducting {CNT} channels with different chiralities are influenced in drastically different ways by a certain applied strain, which is determined by a (n-m) mod 3 rule. In general, a type of strain which produces a larger band gap results in increased {SB} height and decreased band-structure-limited velocity, and hence a smaller minimum leakage current, smaller on current, larger maximum achievable {ION}/{IOFF}, and larger intrinsic delay. The other type of strain that reduces the band gap results in the opposite effect on the device performance metrics of the {CNTFETs}},

	abstract = {The failure in 1945 of experiments proposed by Shockley, on what today would be called thin-film field-effect transistors, was a creative failure that stimulated Bardeen in early 1946 to propose that a surface-state shield blocked the field from the semiconductor's interior. Bell Laboratories' "transistor group to be" for the next eighteen months focused, not on practical, but on scientific aspects of the failure. Focus on the practical resumed (with a step-function increase, lasting several months, in "the will to think" about new concepts of semiconductor amplifiers, as measured by the rate of filling of laboratory notebook pages by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley) on 17 November 1947, when in his surface-state research, Brattain penetrated the shield by applying the field through an electrolyte. Within six days, patentable field-effect transistor inventions were conceived. Although useless as devices, these inventions were creative failures used by Bardeen and Brattain to discover the point-contact transistor three weeks later. Five weeks after this discovery, Shockley conceived the junction transistor while designing "imref" experiments on the point-contact transistor's inversion layer so that in 1951, the point-contact transistor in its turn became a creative failure when replaced by the junction transistor whose conception it had aided. But the path of thought to the conception of the junction transistor and the subsequent path to its practical realization are proven to be highly indirect by historical research on laboratory notebook entries. Specifically, Shockley's conception of the junction transistor was delayed by at least four months because he missed opportunities, obvious by hindsight, to recognize the possibility of minority carrier injection. The author hopes that the presentation of details of his limitations in making this important invention may help readers to accept their own limitations and, thereby, to become more persistent and, hence, creative.},

Integration of individual suspended nanotubes into complex microelectromechanical devices, including gate structures, is still a challenge. Here, ultraclean carbon nanotubes spanning across actuated {MEMS} electrodes are operated as suspended Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors ({CNT}-{FETs}) under repeated variable strain up to 4.5\%, thus acting as small-sized piezoresistive strain gauges whose gauge factor is electrostatically tuned by the gate.

Transport through very short (∼10 nm) nanotubes is free of significant acoustic and optical phonon scattering and thus ballistic and quasiballistic at the low- and high-bias voltage limits, respectively. High currents of up to 70 μA can flow through a short nanotube. Possible mechanisms for the eventual electrical breakdown of short nanotubes at high fields are discussed.

The model is calibrated with recent experimental data down to 9-nm gate length. Device performance of 22- to 7-nm technology nodes is analyzed. The results suggest that contact resistance is the key performance limiter for {CNFETs}; direct source-to-drain tunneling results in significant leakage due to low effective mass in carbon nanotubes and prevents further downscaling of the gate length. The design space that minimizes the gate delay in {CNFETs} subject to {OFF}-state leakage current ({IOFF}) constraints is explored. Through the optimization of the length of the gate, contact, and extension regions to balance the parasitic effects, the gate delay can be improved by more than 10\% at 11- and 7-nm technology nodes compared with the conventional 0.7 × scaling rule, while the {OFF}-state leakage current remains below 0.5 μA/μm .},

As the distance between junctions in modern devices drops below 10 nm, extraordinarily high doping concentration gradients become necessary. Because of the laws of diffusion and the statistical nature of the distribution of the doping atoms, such junctions represent an increasingly difficult fabrication challenge for the semiconductor industry. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new type of transistor in which there are no junctions and no doping concentration gradients. These devices have full {CMOS} functionality and are made using silicon nanowires. They have near-ideal subthreshold slope, extremely low leakage currents, and less degradation of mobility with gate voltage and temperature than classical transistors.},

Albeit topologically simple, they exhibit a rich variety of intriguing electronic properties, such as metallic and semiconducting behaviour. Furthermore, these structures are atomically precise, meaning that each carbon atom is still three-fold coordinated without any dangling bonds. {CNTs} have been used in many laboratories to build prototype nanodevices. These devices include metallic wires, field-effect transistors, electromechanical sensors and displays. They potentially form the basis of future all-carbon electronics. This review deals with the building blocks of understanding the device physics of {CNT}-based nanodevices. There are many features that make {CNTs} different from traditional materials, including chirality-dependent electronic properties, the one-dimensional nature of electrostatic screening and the presence of several direct bandgaps. Understanding these novel properties and their impact on devices is crucial in the development and evolution of {CNT} applications.},

The {CNTs} were grown by the {CVD} method using {LPG} and {LaNi}5 as the carbon source and catalyst, respectively. Pd was impregnated on the {CNTs} by the reflux method with hydrogen gas as a reducing agent, while V was embedded on the {CNTs} by the vapor deposition method. The average metal particle size deposited on the {CNTs} was around 5.8 nm for Pd and 3.6 nm for V. Hydrogen adsorption experiments were performed at room temperature and at −196 °C under a hydrogen pressure of 65 bar. At −196 °C, the treated {CNTs} had a maximum hydrogen uptake of 1.21 wt\%, while the {CNTs} deposited with Pd (Pd-{CNTs}) and {CNTs} deposited with V (V-{CNTs}) possessed lower surface areas, inducing lower hydrogen adsorption capacities of 0.37 and 0.4 wt\%, respectively. For hydrogen sorption at room temperature, the {CNTs} decorated with the metal nanoparticles had a higher hydrogen uptake compared to the treated {CNTs}. Hydrogen adsorption capacity was 0.125 and 0.1 wt\% for the Pd-{CNTs} and V-{CNTs}, respectively, while the hydrogen uptake of the treated {CNTs} was {\textless}0.01 wt\%. For the second cycle, only half of the first hydrogen uptake was obtained, and this was attributed to the re-crystallization of the defect sites on the carbon substrate after the first hydrogen desorption.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental investigations of sub-10nm carbon nanotube ({CNT}) field-effect transistors ({FETs}) promote {CNT} based 1D-electronics as a candidate for a future aggressively scaled transistor technology. However, the ballistic transport within the 1D semiconducting {CNT} channel is largely determined by charge injection from the contacts rendering reliable theoretical predictions of the transistor performance difficult. Based on a simplified heterojunction like contact model, we demonstrate by solving the Schrödinger-Poisson equations that aggressive scaling will rely on a careful balance between two components of the injected charges, one responsible for the formation of near-contact barriers and the other carrying the current. Excellent electrostatic gate control (e.g. employing thin gate oxides) may then enable transistor scaling until the onset of direct source-drain tunneling.},

Transport through very short (∼10 nm) nanotubes is free of significant acoustic and optical phonon scattering and thus ballistic and quasiballistic at the low- and high-bias voltage limits, respectively. High currents of up to 70 μA can flow through a short nanotube. Possible mechanisms for the eventual electrical breakdown of short nanotubes at high fields are discussed.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}) analysis of the nitrogen bonding demonstrates the nitrogen-incorporation profile according to the precursor amount, which indicates the correlation between the nitrogen concentration and morphology of nanotubes. With the increase of melamine amount, the growth rate of nanotubes increases significantly, and the inner structure of {CNx}–{NTs} displayed a regular morphology transition from straight and smooth walls (0 at.\% nitrogen) to cone-stacked shapes or bamboo-like structure (1.5\%), then to corrugated structures (3.1\% and above). Both {XPS} and {CHN} group results indicate that the nitrogen concentration of {CNx}–{NTs} remained almost constant even after exposing them to air for 5 months, revealing superior nitrogen stability in {CNTs}. Raman analysis shows that the intensity ratio of D to G bands ({ID}/{IG}) of nanotubes increases with the melamine amount and position of G-band undergoes a down-shift due to increasing nitrogen doping. The aligned {CNx}–{NTs} with modulated morphology, controlled nitrogen concentration and superior stability may find potential applications in developing various nanodevices such as fuel cells and nanoenergetic functional components.},

The anisotropic etching of Si crystals by alkaline solution is utilized to form V-grooves and to define nanometer-scale channel structures. Ultrathin channels created on the {SOI} have a 3 nm channel length that is determined by the edge of V-grooves. Dopants are introduced by ion implantation at the source and drain regions and diffused into the channel region at a high temperature and by long-period annealing. V-groove {JL}-{FETs} thus fabricated show superior performances by scaling the thickness of the {SOI} channel toward 1 nm and less. Through the measurement of many V-groove {JL}-{FETs} and a simulation study, it is clarified that the management of channel thickness with atomic-scale precision is indispensable for sub-10 nm {FETs}.},

	abstract = {Band-to-band tunneling ({BTBT}) devices have recently gained a lot of interest due to their potential for reducing power dissipation in integrated circuits. We have performed extensive simulations for the {BTBT} operation of carbon nanotube metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors ({CNT}-{MOSFETs}) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism for both ballistic and dissipative quantum transport. In comparison with recently reported experimental data (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 3518?3519), we have obtained strong evidence that {BTBT} in {CNT}-{MOSFETs} is dominated by optical phonon assisted inelastic transport, which can have important implications on the transistor characteristics. It is shown that, under large biasing conditions, two-phonon scattering may also become important.},

The key to the useful implementation of the method is the rigorous estimation of the values for the components of the equivalent circuit. This is achieved by numerical differentiation of the charges and currents resulting from self-consistent solutions to the equations of Schrodinger and Poisson. Sample results are presented, which show that {fT} can have a very unusual dependence on the gate-source bias voltage. This behavior is due mainly to the voltage dependence of the transconductance and capacitance in the presence of quasi-bound states in the nanotube.},

Individual nanotubes appear to be able to carry currents with a density exceeding 109A/cm2. As the bias voltage is increased, the conductance drops dramatically due to scattering of electrons. We show that the current-voltage characteristics can be explained by considering optical or zone-boundary phonon emission as the dominant scattering mechanism at high field.},

After briefly reviewing the electronic structure and transport properties of {CNTs}, we discuss the fabrication of {CNT} field-effect transistors ({CNTFETs}) formed from individual single-walled nanotubes ({SWCNTs}), {SWCNT} bundles, or multiwalled ({MW}) {CNTs}. The performance characteristics of the {CNTFETs} are discussed and compared to those of corresponding silicon devices. We show that {CNTFETs} are very competitive with state-of-the-art conventional devices. We also discuss the switching mechanism of {CNTFETs} and show that it involves the modulation by the gate field of Schottky barriers at the metal-{CNT} junctions. This switching mechanism can account for the observed subthreshold and vertical scaling behavior of {CNTFETs}, as well as their sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen. The potential for integration of {CNT} devices is demonstrated by fabricating a logic gate along a single nanotube molecule. Finally, we discuss our efforts to grow {CNTs} locally and selectively, and a method is presented for growing oriented {SWCNTs} without the involvement of a metal catalyst.},

We show how a well-tempered device design can be accomplished in this regime by choosing suitable doping profiles and gate contact parameters. At the same time, we detail the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the bulk-switching operation, including them in a very practical and accurate model, whose parameters can be easily controlled in order to improve the device performance.

The {CNFET} Model is a circuit-compatible, compact model which describes enhancement-mode, {CMOS}-like {CNFETs}. It can be used to simulate both functionality and performance of large-scale circuits with hundreds of {CNFETs}. To produce realistic and relevant results, the model accounts for several practical non-idealities such as scattering in the near-ballistic channel, effects of the source/drain extension region, and charge-screening for multiple-nanotube {CNFETs}. The model also includes a full transcapacitance network for more accurate transient and {AC} results. The Stanford University {CNFET} Model is implemented in both {HSPICE} macro language and {VerilogA}. The {VerilogA} implementation shows speedups of roughly 7x∼15x over {HSPICE}. Applications of the model suggest that n- and p-{CNFETs} will have 6x and 13x speed advantage over Si n- and p-{MOSFETs} respectively at the 32nm node, and that a {CNT} density of 250 {CNTs}/um is ideal for multiple-nanotube gates. Such a compact {CNFET} model will be absolutely essential in ushering in the Design Era of {CNFET} circuits as carbon nanotube technology outgrows its “science discovery” phase.},

One-dimensional models are used to predict the substrate doping profile and the corresponding threshold voltage versus source voltage characteristic. A two-dimensional current transport model is used to predict the relative degree of short-channel effects for different device parameter combinations. Polysilicon-gate {MOSFET}'s with channel lengths as short as 0.5 μ were fabricated, and the device characteristics measured and compared with predicted values. The performance improvement expected from using these very small devices in highly miniaturized integrated circuits is projected.},

Therefore, a compact model is built from density functional theory ({DFT}), compared with results of molecular dynamics ({MD}) that describes the mechanics of carbon nanotubes in a parameterized way. The results for the interesting kind of {CNTs} [(6,3) and (7,4)] within the two approaches agree in a satisfying way, when {DFT}-calculations are performed with atomic configurations obtained by {MD} geometry optimization. Geometry optimization yields the Poisson's ratio for {CNTs}. Thus, values from {MD} and {DFT} are compared. The simulation finally aims the modeling of the conductive behavior of {CNTs} when strain is applied, but this needs further verification. Here, we present the prediction of the tight binding model for suitable {CNTs}.},

As the distance between junctions in modern devices drops below 10 nm, extraordinarily high doping concentration gradients become necessary. Because of the laws of diffusion and the statistical nature of the distribution of the doping atoms, such junctions represent an increasingly difficult fabrication challenge for the semiconductor industry. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new type of transistor in which there are no junctions and no doping concentration gradients. These devices have full {CMOS} functionality and are made using silicon nanowires. They have near-ideal subthreshold slope, extremely low leakage currents, and less degradation of mobility with gate voltage and temperature than classical transistors.},

This “semiconductor revolution” has been possible because semiconductor devices have the unique feature that as they become smaller they also become faster, consume less power, become cheaper per circuit, and enable more function per unit area of Si. As the basic device approaches atomic dimensions, it is not clear how far scaling can continue, which current processing technologies lack extendibility, and what innovative process technologies will emerge to take their place. Examination of some of the requirements set forth in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ({ITRS}) [1] will expose some of the process modules that are likely to limit scaling. Future work that might be developed to meet the needs of the {CMOS} roadmap will then be initiated. Among the processes being developed for futur e needs are a range of self-limited growth and etching reactions as well as other process steps that take advantage of atomic-level control and manipulation to enable new classes of substrate materials. The requirements that drive such a level of control, as well as the progress and prospects for these new techniques, are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {A common feature of the single-walled carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors fabricated to date has been the presence of a Schottky barrier at the nanotube–metal junctions. These energy barriers severely limit transistor conductance in the '{ON}' state, and reduce the current delivery capability—a key determinant of device performance. Here we show that contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes by palladium, a noble metal with high work function and good wetting interactions with nanotubes, greatly reduces or eliminates the barriers for transport through the valence band of nanotubes. In situ modification of the electrode work function by hydrogen is carried out to shed light on the nature of the contacts. With Pd contacts, the '{ON}' states of semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted ballistic metallic tubes, exhibiting room-temperature conductance near the ballistic transport limit of 4e 2/h (refs 4–6), high current-carrying capability (25 A per tube), and Fabry–Perot interferences at low temperatures. Under high voltage operation, the current saturation appears to be set by backscattering of the charge carriers by optical phonons. High-performance ballistic nanotube field-effect transistors with zero or slightly negative Schottky barriers are thus realized.},

	abstract = {Most carbon nanotube field-effect transistors ({CNTFETs}) directly attach metal source/drain contacts to an intrinsic nanotube channel. When the gate oxide thickness is reduced, such transistors display strong ambipolar conduction, even when the Schottky barrier for electrons (or for holes) is zero. The resulting leakage current, which increases exponentially with the drain voltage, constrains the potential applications of such devices. In this paper, we use numerical simulations to show that if {CNT} based metal-oxide-semiconductor ({MOS}) {FETs} can be achieved by using heavily doped {CNT} sections as source and drain, ambipolar conduction will be suppressed, leakage current will be reduced, and the scaling limit imposed by source-drain tunneling will be extended. By eliminating the Schottky barrier between the source and channel, the transistor will be capable of delivering more on-current. The leakage current of such devices will be controlled by the full bandgap of {CNTs} (instead of half of the bandgap for {SB} {CNTFETs}) and band-to-band tunneling. These factors will depend on the diameter of nanotubes and the power supply voltage.},

The effect of phonon scattering on the device characteristics of {CNT}-{FETs} is explored using extensive numerical simulation. Both intra- and intervalley scattering mediated by acoustic ({AP}), optical ({OP}), and radial-breathing-mode ({RBM}) phonons are treated. Realistic phonon dispersion calculations are performed using force- constant methods, and electron-phonon coupling is determined through microscopic theory. Specific simulation results are presented for (16,0), (19,0), and (22,0) zigzag {CNTFETs}, which are in the experimentally useful diameter range. We find that the effect of phonon scattering on device performance has a distinct bias dependence. Up to moderate gate biases, the influence of high-energy {OP} scattering is suppressed, and the device current is reduced due to elastic backscattering by {AP} and low-energy {RBM} phonons. At large gate biases, the current degradation is mainly due to high-energy {OP} scattering. The influence of both {AP} and high-energy {OP} scattering is reduced for larger diameter tubes. The effect of {RBM} mode, however, is nearly independent of the diameter for the tubes studied here.},

For the densely packed array of nanotubes on a planar insulator, the capacitance per tube is reduced due to the screening of the charge on the gate plane by the neighboring nanotubes. In contrast to the silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors, the calculated C–V curves reflect the local peaks of the one-dimensional density-of-states in the nanotube. This effect provides the possibility to use C–V measurements to diagnose the electronic structures of nanotubes. Results of the electrostatic calculations can also be applied to estimate the upper-limit on-current of carbon nanotubefield-effect transistors.},

We achieve such performance by exposure to potassium (K) vapor and device annealing in high vacuum. The treatment has a twofold effect to: (i) controllably shift V th toward negative gate biases via bulk doping of the nanotube (up to about 0.6e − / nm ), and (ii) increase the on-current by 1–2 orders of magnitude. This current enhancement is achieved by lowering external device resistance due to more intimate contact between K metal and doped nanotube channel in addition to potential reduction of the Schottky barrier height at the contact.},

High-density, uniform semiconducting nanotube networks are deposited at wafer scale using our {APTES}-assisted nanotube deposition technique, and {RF} transistors with channel lengths down to 500 nm are fabricated. We report on transistors exhibiting a cutoff frequency (ft) of 5 {GHz} and with maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 1.5 {GHz}. Besides the cutoff frequency, the other important figure of merit for the {RF} transistors is the device linearity. For the first time, we report carbon nanotube {RF} transistor linearity metrics up to 1 {GHz}. Without the use of active probes to provide the high impedance termination, the measurement bandwidth is therefore not limited, and the linearity measurements can be conducted at the frequencies where the transistors are intended to be operating. We conclude that semiconducting nanotube-based transistors are potentially promising building blocks for highly linear {RF} electronics and circuit applications.},

Because of these remarkable properties, they have been expected for use as wiring materials and as alternate channel materials for extending complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS}) performance in future very large scale integration ({VLSI}) technologies. In this paper, we report the present status of {CNT} growth technologies and the applications for via interconnects (vertical wiring) and field-effect transistors ({FETs}). We fabricated {CNT} via and evaluated its robustness over a high-density current. In our technology, multiwalled carbon nanotubes ({MWNTs}) were successfully grown at temperatures as low as 365°C using Co catalyst nanoparticles, which were formed and deposited by a custom-designed particle generation and deposition system. The density of {MWNTs} grown at 450°C reaches more than 1×1012/cm2. {MWNTs} were grown in via holes with a diameter as small as 40 nm. The resistance of {CNT} vias with a diameter of 160 nm was found to be of the same order as that of tungsten plugs. The {CNT} via was able to sustain a current density as high as 5.0×106A/cm2 at 105°C for 100 h without any deterioration in its properties. We propose a Si-process compatible technique to control carrier polarity of {CNFETs} by utilizing fixed charges introduced by the gate oxide. High-performance p- and n-type {CNFETs} and {CMOS} inverters with stability in air have been realized.},

Further system miniaturization will demand for continuous down-scaling of sensor functions in such systems most likely towards nanoscale. Then new sensor device concepts will emerge to improve performance, e.g. sensitivity, or to utilize unique functional properties of nanoscale structures. This paper presents concepts and demonstrators of nano electromechanical sensors based on carbon nanotubes ({CNTs}). First, different transducer concepts based on the unique electrical, mechanical and electromechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes ({SWNTs}) are addressed and discussed. Second, fabrication techniques and methods for the integration of {SWNTs} in micro or nanosystems are presented. Finally, demonstrators of suspended {SWNT}-based cantilever structures and a membrane-based nanotube pressure sensor are introduced and evaluated.

We examine experimentally and theoretically how an iron nanocrystal can pass through a constriction in the carbon nanotube with a smaller cross-sectional area than the nanocrystal itself. Remarkably, through in situ transmission electron imaging and diffraction, we find that, while passing through a constriction, the nanocrystal remains largely solid and crystalline and the carbon nanotube is unaffected. We account for this behavior by a pattern of iron atom motion and rearrangement on the surface of the nanocrystal. The nanocrystal motion can be described with a model whose parameters are nearly independent of the nanocrystal length, area, temperature, and electromigration force magnitude. We predict that metal nanocrystals can move through complex geometries and constrictions, with implications for both nanomechanics and tunable synthesis of metal nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density ({LSD}) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction ({SIC}) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to {LSD} and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected {LSD} approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of {SIC} in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in {LSD}, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that {SIC} can also remedy the {LSD} underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and {CuCl}), and the {LSD} overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The {LSD} spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by {SIC}. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

The doping effects are investigated by N substitution for the carbon atom while the molecule adsorption effects are studied by adsorbing a H2O molecule or an {OH} group on the top of one carbon atom, respectively. The transmission function around the Fermi level is highly dependent on the doping or adsorption site. The effects are negligible when the site is at the interface, while it always forms a scattering barrier which causes a valley of the transmission spectra around the Fermi level when the doping/adsorption site is inside the sandwiched {CNT}(6,0). The conductance of {CNT} intramolecular junctions is very sensitive to the environment, which may provide potential of application in future nanoelectronic devices and gas sensors.},

	abstract = {We investigate the piezoresistive effect of carbon nanotubes ({CNTs}) within density functional theory ({DFT}) aiming at application-relevant {CNTs}. {CNTs} are excellent candidates for the usage in nano-electromechanical sensors ({NEMSs}) due to their small band gap at zero strain leading to a finite resistivity at room temperature. The application of strain induces a band gap-opening leading to a tremendous change in the resistivity. {DFT} with the {LDA} approximation yields reasonable results for pure carbon systems like {CNTs} and is applied to calculate the electronic structure of experimentally relevant {CNTs}. For the transport part, a simple ballistic transport model based on the band gap is used. We compare our {DFT} results for the band gaps of strained {CNTs} to results of tight binding ({TB}) models. By introducing a scaling factor of \${\textbackslash}sqrt \{2\} \$, an excellent agreement of the {DFT} data with {TB} model, published by Yang and Han [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 154 (2000)], is obtained.},

A conformal transformation is applied to overcome the problems that arise in this open structure of specifying boundary conditions and of terminating the model space. The effect on the potential distribution within the transistor of changing various geometrical properties of the device is investigated, and some special conditions under which appropriate boundary conditions may be defined a priori are identified. The effects on the potential energy profile along the nanotube of varying the work function of the end contacts, and of introducing charge into the gate dielectric, are also investigated. The latter is shown to be effective in suppressing the otherwise dominant role that the end contacts play in determining the barrier to charge flow in the nanotube, thereby allowing bulk control to occur.},

The transistors show favorable device characteristics such as high gain ({\textgreater}10), a large on-off ratio ({\textgreater}105), and room-temperature operation. Importantly, the local-gate layout allows for integration of multiple devices on a single chip. Indeed, we demonstrate one-, two-, and three-transistor circuits that exhibit a range of digital logic operations, such as an inverter, a logic {NOR}, a static random-access memory cell, and an ac ring oscillator.},

For nonsymmorphic carbon nanotubes (8,4) and (10,5), the top of the highest occupied valence band and the bottom of the lowest unoccupied conduction band are not at the Γ point, but at about ±0.1(1,0,0)π/L, where the tubule axis is defined as the (1,0,0) direction. The band gaps in the nonsymmorphic (8,4) and (10,5) can be direct for transitions at +0.1(1,0,0)π/L or −0.1(1,0,0)π/L, and can also be indirect for transitions from +0.1(1,0,0)π/L to −0.1(1,0,0)π/L, or vice versa.},

Interestingly we find that the (5,0) system, expected to be a large gap semiconductor, is metallic.

Pd is found to nucleate at defective sites, whether initially present or introduced by oxygen plasma treatment. The plasma treatment induced a uniform dispersion of Pd clusters at the {CNT}-surface. The absence of additional features in the Pd 3d and C 1s core levels spectra testifies that no Pd–C bond is formed. The shift of the Pd 3d core level towards high-binding energy for the smallest clusters is attributed to the Coulomb energy of the charged final state.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the transport properties of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors ({CNTFETs}), with a nonequilibrium Green's function ({NEGF}) method. Tunneling leakage currents with respect to gate voltages are known effects for {MOSFET}-like {CNTFETs} ({MOSCNTs}). To minimize this phenomenon, we have proposed a structure with a simple modification of the {MOSCNT} by using lightly doped regions between the intrinsic channel and the highly doped source and drain regions, which we call the Â¿lightly doped drain and source {CNTFET} ({LDDS}-{CNTFET}).Â¿ Simulations have shown that {LDDS}-{CNTFET} characteristics are related to the lightly doped region concentration. In comparison with an {MOSCNT} and a linearly doped {CNTFET} ({LD}-{CNTFET}), an {LDDS}-{CNTFET} with appropriately doped lightly doped drain and source regions has demonstrated a larger on current (I on), a larger on -off ratio (I on/I off), a superior ambipolar characteristic, a shorter delay time, and also a smaller power-delay product. Furthermore, our results show that the channel length for an {LDDS}-{CNTFET} is shorter than that for an {LD}-{CNTFET} having the same off-state characteristics. Finally, the effect of the unavoidable Schottky barriers at the interface of the heavily doped source/drain regions and their metal electrodes has been taken into account. Simulations have demonstrated that these Schottky barriers have almost the same deteriorating effects on the characteristics for both {LD}-{CNTFETs} and {LDDS}-{CNTFETs}. Hence, all discussions regarding the superiority of the proposed structure are also valid in presence of the Schottky barriers.},
