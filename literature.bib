	abstract = {A new kinetic Monte Carlo ({KMC}) method is presented to investigate the atomic layer deposition ({ALD}) of alumina onto silicon. Atoms are located on predefined sites and thus do not move continuously. This lattice-based {KMC} approach requires preliminary physical considerations on the crystal structures that we aim to reproduce, especially in the case of heterogeneous systems like high-[kappa] oxides deposition on silicon. Atomistic configuration changes are performed by local events: these are elementary reactional mechanisms occurring on specific sites. The temporal dynamics is governed by transition probabilities, calculated for every event from activation barriers, {ALD} process parameters and random numbers. Mechanism activation energies may come from ab initio calculations, literature or experiments. We show that this kind of algorithm is computation-time-cheap enough to allow huge systems simulations: up to millions of atoms and events during a few hours on an ordinary computer.},

	abstract = {A comparison is made between single-wafer and (vertical) batch systems for Atomic Layer Deposition ({ALD}). Various characteristic times that play a role in such systems are compared. Many of these characteristic times are substantially shorter in single wafer systems. In case wafers with a high density of deep trenches are processed in a batch system, the required length of the precursor pulse could be as long as 10-60 s, depending on the specific chemistry of the process. This time is largely determined by the time it takes to saturate the very large surface of the trenched substrates. Despite that, batch systems with load sizes of 50-100 wafers are superior in terms of overall throughput.
Two classes of {ALD} processes are distinguished, [`]normal' {ALD}, in which the active precursors are separated by inert gas purges, and partial {ALD} in which one of the {ALD} steps is replaced by a pulsed {CVD} step. In the first category two examples are discussed, Al2O3 and {HfO}2 {ALD}, characterized by short and long surface saturation times, respectively. In the second category (partial) {ALD} of {TiN} and Si3N4 are discussed. First a thin {TiN} layer is deposited through a short {CVD} pulse; in the second, true {ALD} pulse {NH}3 reacts with the {TiN} surface to remove any remaining Cl. It is demonstrated that this procedure combines a high overall growth rate with a low sheet resistance. In the Si3N4 process the first pulse is a {CVD} process in which a thin layer of amorphous Si is deposited. In the second ({ALD}) pulse N and/or {NH}2 radicals generated by a remote plasma are used to convert the Si into Si3N4. The paper concludes with a short discussion on new types of carbide and nitride films that have potential to be deposited in batch type {ALD} systems.},

	abstract = {The structural properties of amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been investigated by means of the molecular dynamics technique. The simulations were done in a microcanonical ensemble, using a pairwise potential, on systems with up to 1800 particles. Three different systems, at densities ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 g/cm3, were prepared by quenching from the melt. The network topology of our system is analyzed through partial pair correlations, coordination numbers, angle distributions, and ring statistics. A detailed analysis of the interatomic distances reveals that in the amorphous state there is a short-range order dominated by a slightly distorted ({AlO}4)5- tetrahedron, in agreement with recent experimental results. This conclusion is supported by the distribution of nearest-neighbor coordination numbers, where more than 75\% of Al atoms have four O as nearest-neighbors. Ring statistics reveal the presence of two- to fivefold rings, with a peak at the fourfold ring and where the two- and threefold rings are planar. Comparison with available experimental data and earlier calculations shows that the structures of amorphous and liquid alumina are very similar. The amorphous structure also presents close similarities to the surface structure of γ-alumina at room temperature. Simulations for systems at different densities show that the coordination number of the elementary unit increases as the density increases, suggesting that the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated forms of amorphous alumina found experimentally correspond to different densities.},

While the outer shell of the icosahedron-like particle shows crystalline feature with \{1 1 1\}-like facets, the inner core remains amorphous. It is found that the structure of the fully crystallized particle is polycrystalline face-centered cubic (fcc).

Three common structural morphologies for gold nanoclusters were considered: Icosahedral, defected icosahedral, and amorphous. The clusters were structurally relaxed and then analyzed by a structure measure technique using planar graphs. The free energies for the different cluster morphologies are also predicted as a function of cluster size. We show that glue potential can correctly predict the most stable structures observed in experiments from molecular dynamics simulations within the nanocluster size range we considered and that the effect of surface disorder is important in considering the stability of the nanoclusters.},

The simulation shows that the sputtered flux for normally cluster incidence has a significant lateral momentum component. By oblique cluster incidence the sputtered flux is predominantly directed into a mirror angle. The sputtered surface material contains not only atoms but also small clusters. The preliminary results of the simulation of Ar cluster ions implantation after their impact on the Si(001) target shows that a significant amount of impinging Ar cluster atoms can be implanted into the target subsurface region.},

	abstract = {Ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo ({KMC}) simulations have been successfully applied for over two decades to elucidate the underlying physico-chemical phenomena on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts. These simulations necessitate detailed knowledge of the kinetics of elementary reactions constituting the reaction mechanism, and the energetics of the species participating in the chemistry. The information about the energetics is encoded in the formation energies of gas and surface-bound species, and the lateral interactions between adsorbates on the catalytic surface, which can be modeled at different levels of detail. The majority of previous works accounted for only pairwise-additive first nearest-neighbor interactions. More recently, cluster-expansion Hamiltonians incorporating long-range interactions and many-body terms have been used for detailed estimations of catalytic rate [C. Wu, D. J. Schmidt, C. Wolverton, and W. F. Schneider, J. Catal.286, 88 (2012)]. In view of the increasing interest in accurate predictions of catalytic performance, there is a need for general-purpose {KMC} approaches incorporating detailed cluster expansion models for the adlayer energetics. We have addressed this need by building on the previously introduced graph-theoretical {KMC} framework, and we have developed Zacros, a {FORTRAN}2003 {KMC} package for simulating catalytic chemistries. To tackle the high computational cost in the presence of long-range interactions we introduce parallelization with {OpenMP}. We further benchmark our framework by simulating a {KMC} analogue of the {NO} oxidation system established by Schneider and co-workers [J. Catal.286, 88 (2012)]. We show that taking into account only first nearest-neighbor interactions may lead to large errors in the prediction of the catalytic rate, whereas for accurate estimates thereof, one needs to include long-range terms in the cluster expansion.},

We have developed a novel approach that employs graph-theoretical ideas to overcome these challenges and treat easily complex chemistries. As a benchmark, the Ziff-Gulari-Barshad system is simulated and comparisons of the computational times of the graph-theoretical {KMC} and a simpler {KMC} approach are made.

One of the main characteristics of this new algorithm is its generality: it can be simply extended to triangulate point sets in any dimension. The technique adopted is very efficient and presents a subquadratic behaviour in real applications in E3, although its computational complexity does not improve the theoretical bounds reported in the literature. An evaluation of the performance on a number of datasets is reported, together with a comparison with other {DT} algorithms.},

Nondefective models include clusters representing the site above a fully coordinated surface Si atom and bridging O atoms, and the defective models include clusters representing an under-coordinated Si defect, a nonbridging O defect, and a ring structure. Energies were obtained for the approach of atomic and molecular oxygen to these clusters in various configurations by using explicitly correlated {CCSD}(T)-F12b electronic structure theory and the Minnesota density functionals, which were found to be in good agreement. The Minnesota functionals were employed in binding energy calculations for all of the clusters, considering the singlet and triplet spin states for nondefective clusters and doublet and quartet spin states for defective clusters. We find that the chosen defects are energetically favorable sites for binding. The density functional energies were used to extend the empirical {ReaxFFSiO} potential for silica, which was previously parametrized for bulk silica polymorphs (van Duin et al. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2003, 107, 3803?3811), to model the gas?surface interactions represented by the defective and nondefective clusters presented here. Interaction energy predictions from {ReaxFFSiOGSI} agree very well with the density functional energies. {ReaxFFSiOGSI} can now be employed in reactive large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving oxygen?silica gas?surface interactions such as oxide growth and the heterogeneous recombination of oxygen occurring on real silica surfaces.},

	abstract = {Simulations of the initial oxidation process of a {SiC} surface exposed to O2 and H2O molecules was studied with {ReaxFF}, an atomically detailed reactive molecular dynamics method that naturally models the breaking and forming of bonds. In this work, the {ReaxFF} forcefield was first expanded by training it with new quantum mechanics data of the binding energy, equation of state, and heat of formation of the {SiC} crystal, along with data from earlier studies that describes Si ? Si, Si ? O, and Si ? H interactions. This expanded {ReaxFF} forcefield is capable of simultaneously describing both Si?C?O and Si?O?H bonding interactions. Using the forcefield, oxidation simulations were performed at various temperatures (in the range of 500 to 5000 K), and the trajectories were analyzed. The analyses showed that {SiC} gradually transforms into the oxides of silicon with simultaneous formation of a graphite-like layer. In presence of excess O2, the graphite-like layer was further oxidized to {CO} and {CO}2. We also analyzed the trajectories with two-atom and three-atom clusters to quantitatively track the oxidation progress. This analysis clearly showed Si?O and C?C bond formation at the expense of O?O and Si?C bond consumption indicating {SiC} oxidation with simultaneous formation for carbon-like structure. Consumption of {SiC} with O2 was found to be faster than that with H2O. We have also reported the oxidation simulation of {SiC} with a mixture of H2O and O2. Oxidation proceeded effectively as a two-part sequence, with O2 first oxidizing the {SiC}, followed then by H2O.},

In agreement with experimental observation, these simulations predict that {TATB} decomposition quickly (by 30 ps) initiates the formation of large carbonaceous clusters (more than 4000 amu, or ?15?30\% of the total system mass), and {HMX} decomposition leads almost exclusively to small-molecule products. We find that {HMX} decomposes readily on this time scale at lower temperatures, for which the decomposition rate of {TATB} is about an order of magnitude slower. Analyzing the {ReaxFF} {MD} results leads to the detailed atomistic structure of this carbon-rich phase of {TATB} and allows characterization of the kinetics and chemistry related to this phase and their dependence on system density and temperature. The carbon-rich phase formed from {TATB} contains mainly polyaromatic rings with large oxygen content, leading to graphitic regions. We use these results to describe the initial reaction steps of thermal decomposition of {HMX} and {TATB} in terms of the rates for forming primary and secondary products, allowing comparison to experimentally derived models. These studies show that {MD} using the {ReaxFF} reactive force field provides detailed atomistic information that explains such macroscopic observations as the dramatic difference in carbon cluster formation between {TATB} and {HMX}. This shows that {ReaxFF} {MD} captures the fundamental differences in the mechanisms of such systems and illustrates how the {ReaxFF} may be applied to model complex chemical phenomena in energetic materials. The studies here illustrate this for modestly sized systems and modest periods; however, {ReaxFF} calculations of reactive processes have already been reported on systems with ?106 atoms. Thus, with suitable computational facilities, one can study the atomistic level chemical processes in complex systems under extreme conditions.},

	abstract = {To investigate the failure of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer ({PDMS}) at high temperatures and pressures and in the presence of various additives, we have expanded the {ReaxFF} reactive force field to describe carbonsilicon systems. From molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations using {ReaxFF} we find initial thermal decomposition products of {PDMS} to be {CH}3 radical and the associated polymer radical, indicating that decomposition and subsequent cross-linking of the polymer is initiated by {SiC} bond cleavage, in agreement with experimental observations. Secondary reactions involving these {CH}3 radicals lead primarily to formation of methane. We studied temperature and pressure dependence of {PDMS} decomposition by following the rate of production of methane in the {ReaxFF} {MD} simulations. We tracked the temperature dependency of the methane production to extract Arrhenius parameters for the failure modes of {PDMS}. Furthermore, we found that at increased pressures the rate of {PDMS} decomposition drops considerably, leading to the formation of fewer {CH}3 radicals and methane molecules. Finally, we studied the influence of various additives on {PDMS} stability. We found that the addition of water or a {SiO}2 slab has no direct effect on the short-term stability of {PDMS}, but addition of reactive species such as ozone leads to significantly lower {PDMS} decomposition temperature. The addition of nitrogen monoxide does not significantly alter the degradation temperature but does retard the initial production of methane and C2 hydrocarbons until the nitrogen monoxide is depleted. These results, and their good agreement with available experimental data, demonstrate that {ReaxFF} provides a useful computational tool for studying the chemical stability of polymers.},

	abstract = {The practical levels of density functional theory ({DFT}) for solids ({LDA}, {PBE}, {PW}91, B3LYP) are well-known not to account adequately for the London dispersion (van der Waals attraction) so important in molecular solids, leading to equilibrium volumes for molecular crystals ?10?15\% too high. The {ReaxFF} reactive force field is based on fitting such {DFT} calculations and suffers from the same problem. In the paper we extend {ReaxFF} by adding a London dispersion term with a form such that it has low gradients (lg) at valence distances leaving the already optimized valence interactions intact but behaves as 1/R6 for large distances. We derive here these lg corrections to {ReaxFF} based on the experimental crystal structure data for graphite, polyethylene ({PE}), carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and for energetic materials: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-s-triazine ({RDX}), pentaerythritol tetranitrate ({PETN}), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene ({TATB}), and nitromethane ({NM}). After this dispersion correction the average error of predicted equilibrium volumes decreases from 18.5 to 4.2\% for the above systems. We find that the calculated crystal structures and equation of state with {ReaxFF}-lg are in good agreement with experimental results. In particular, we examined the phase transition between α-{RDX} and ?-{RDX}, finding that {ReaxFF}-lg leads to excellent agreement for both the pressure and volume of this transition occurring at ?4.8 {GPa} and ?2.18 g/cm3 density from {ReaxFF}-lg vs 3.9 {GPa} and ?2.21 g/cm3 from experiment. We expect {ReaxFF}-lg to improve the descriptions of the phase diagrams for other energetic materials.},

The potential accurately reproduces the lattice parameter, cohesive energy, elastic constants, phonon frequencies, thermal expansion, lattice-defect energies, as well as energies of alternate structures of Ag. Combining this potential with an existing {EAM} potential for Cu, a binary potential set for the Cu–Ag system has been constructed by fitting the cross-interaction function to first-principles energies of imaginary Cu–Ag compounds. Although properties used in the fit refer to the 0 K temperature (except for thermal expansion factors of pure Cu and Ag) and do not include liquid configurations, the potentials demonstrate good transferability to high-temperature properties. In particular, the entire Cu–Ag phase diagram calculated with the new potentials in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations is in satisfactory agreement with experiment. This agreement suggests that {EAM} potentials accurately fit to 0 K properties can be capable of correctly predicting simple phase diagrams. Possible applications of the new potential set are outlined.},

The fitting database consists of {DFT} calculations of Cu monomers and dimers on Ag(1 1 1), specifically their relative energies, adatom heights, and dimer separations. We start from the Mishin Cu–Ag {EAM} potential and first modify the Cu–Ag pair potential to match the {FCC}/{HCP} site energy difference then include Cu–Cu pair potential optimization for the entire database. The potential generated from this optimization method gives better agreement to {DFT} calculations of Cu monomers, dimers, and trimers than previous {EAMs} as well as a {SEAM} optimized potential. In trimer calculations, the optimized potential produces the {DFT} relative energy between {FCC} and {HCP} trimers, though a different ground state is predicted. We use the optimized potential to calculate diffusion barriers for Cu monomers, dimers, and trimers. The predicted monomer barrier is the same as {DFT}, while experimental barriers for monomers and dimers are lower than predicted here. We attribute the difference with experiment to the overestimation of surface adsorption energies by {DFT} and a simple correction is presented. Our results show that this optimization method is suitable for other heteroepitaxial systems; and that the optimized Cu–Ag {EAM} can be applied in the study of larger Cu islands on Ag(1 1 1).},

For this application, it is important that the {EAM} potential accurately reproduces melting properties and liquid structure, in addition to the crystalline properties most commonly fit in its development. To test the accuracy of previously published {EAM} potentials and to guide the development of new potential in this work, first-principles calculations have been performed and new experimental measurements of the Al and Cu liquid structure factors have been undertaken by X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate that the previously published {EAM} potentials predict a liquid structure that is too strongly ordered relative to measured diffraction data. We develop new {EAM} potentials for Al and Cu to improve the agreement with the first-principles and measured liquid diffraction data. Furthermore, we calculate liquid-phase diffusivities and find that this quantity correlates well with the liquid structure. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of crystal nucleation from the melt during quenching at constant cooling rate. We find that {EAM} potentials, which predict the same zero-temperature crystal properties but different liquid structures, can lead to quite different crystallization kinetics. More interestingly, we find that two potentials predicting very similar equilibrium solid and liquid properties can still produce very different crystallization kinetics under far-from-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the rapid quenching simulations employed here.},

The {GMR} properties of these films are a sensitive function of structure and defects in the films and therefore depend upon the processing conditions used for their synthesis. A three-dimensional molecular dynamics method has been developed to simulate the [111] growth of model Ni/Cu/Ni multilayers and was used to investigate the role of vapor atom impact energy upon the film structure and defects. High incident atom energies were found to lower interfacial roughness but promoted intermixing by an atomic exchange mechanism. Low incident energies reduced intermixing, but resulted in films with rough, defective interfaces. The simulations identified an intermediate incident energy between 1 and 2 {eV} that resulted in both low roughness and intermixing, and an anticipated large {GMR} effect. The simulation methodology was extended to explore the benefits of a modulated incident atom energy deposition strategy. When a thermal energy was used to deposit the first few monolayers of each new metal layer, intermixing by the exchange mechanism during subsequent hyperthermal energy deposition could be eliminated, and films with almost no interfacial roughness or intermixing could be grown. The modulated energy deposition method can be simply implemented using ion beam deposition.},

	abstract = {Experimental results show that a nanolayered composite structure made of two kinds of metals strengthens dramatically as the layer thickness is reduced. In epitaxial systems, this strengthening has been attributed to the modulus, lattice parameter, gamma surface and slip-plane mismatches between adjacent layers. The modulus mismatch (the Koehler barrier) introduces a force between a dislocation and its image in the interface. The lattice parameter mismatch generates oscillating coherency stresses and van der Merwe misfit dislocations at or near the interfaces, which interact with mobile dislocations. The gamma surface (chemical) mismatch introduces a localized force on gliding dislocations due to core energy changes at or near the interfaces. Slip-plane misorientations across the interfaces require mobile screw dislocations to cross-slip for slip transmission and other dislocations to leave a difference dislocation at the interface. In this paper, atomistic simulations using the embedded-atom method are used to study the four components of dislocation–interface interactions in epitaxial Cu–Ni multilayers in a systematic fashion. The interaction of misfit dislocations with mobile dislocations is modelled using continuum theory. In thick Cu–Ni bilayers, the Koehler barrier is almost independent of interface orientation and dislocation character and is equal to 0.01μ–0.015μ but, when the layer thickness is comparable with the core width of a dislocation, the Koehler barrier falls rapidly (from 0.01μ at a wavelength of 10nm to 0.004μ at 1.75 nm). This behaviour is in accordance with available experimental observations in the literature on the yield of epitaxial Cu–Ni multilayered systems. The gamma surface mismatch or chemical strengthening component of the blocking strength of Cu–Ni interfaces to (a/2)(110) screw dislocations is 0.003μ, a factor of three lower than the Koehler stress. Coherency stresses, apart from exerting direct forces on dislocations, alter the barrier strengths by three mechanisms: firstly, they reduce the density of van der Merwe misfit dislocations, secondly, they enhance the Koehler barrier by altering the elastic constants of both Cu and Ni and, thirdly, non-glide stress components change the core structure of gliding dislocations, thereby altering the Koehler barrier. Overall, the barrier strength of (111) interfaces is independent of the wavelength of the multilayer and about 0.02μ up to the wavelength of Λc, the coherence wavelength limit. At Cu(001)–Ni(001) interfaces the total barrier strength decreases from a value of 0.02μ at long wavelengths (Λ ≈ ∞) to about 0.01μ at Λ = Λc, as considered by Rao et al. in 1995 in their yield stress model for Cu–Ni multilayered structures. Slip-plane misorientations provide powerful barriers to slip transmission. Even at a (111) twinned interface in a coherent Cu–Ni multilayer, screw dislocations cross-slip on to the interface rather than into Ni because the stacking-fault energy at the interface is lower than in Ni. The blocking strength of the same interface to 60° dislocations (which must leave a step and a residual dislocation in the boundary) is very large, 0.03–0.04μ.},

The colour of the as-deposited films changes from blue to green with increasing deposition time. After 1 hour annealing at 300°C the structures acquire red colour regardless of the film thickness. The annealing results in dramatic changes of surface morphology and roughness and creation of relatively large “spherolytic and hummock-like” structures in the gold layer. For deposited structures a non-zero optical band gap {EoptgE}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{opt\}\} was determined from {UV}-Vis spectra using Tauc’s model and it indicates a semi-conducting character of the structures. The annealing leads to an increase of the band gap. Electrical resistance of the deposited unannealed structures decreases dramatically for deposition times above 50 s. For annealed structures the resistance fall comes until after 250 s deposition time.},

In addition, the structural evolutions of the nanosized clusters during the melting transition were monitored and revealed. It is found that the melting process has three characteristic time periods for the intermediate nanosized clusters. The whole process includes surface disordering and reordering, followed by surface melting and a final rapid overall melting.

The good agreement found with dilatometric results suggests that vacancy-type defects do not make a large contribution to thermal expansion for these oxides, even near the melting point, justifying the use of X-ray diffraction for determining volume properties up to very high temperatures. Thermal expansion coefficients were determined from the measured cell volumes with equations of the form α=α0 + α1 T + α2/T 2. Along with available isobaric heat capacity and compressibility data, these derived coefficients clearly show that anharmonic effects contribute little to the isochoric heat capacities (C v ) of {CaO}, {MgO}, and Al2O3, which do not depart appreciably from the 3nR Dulong and Petit limit.},

The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated.

	abstract = {In plasma-based deposition processing, the importance of low-energy ion bombardment during thin film growth can hardly be exaggerated. Ion bombardment is an important physical tool available to materials scientists in the design of new materials and new structures. Glow discharges and in particular, the magnetron sputtering discharge have the advantage that the ions of the discharge are abundantly available to the deposition process. However, the ion chemistry is usually dominated by the ions of the inert sputtering gas while ions of the sputtered material are rare. Over the last few years, various ionized sputtering techniques have appeared that can achieve a high degree of ionization of the sputtered atoms, often up to 50\% but in some cases as much as approximately 90\%. This opens a complete new perspective in the engineering and design of new thin film materials. The development and application of magnetron sputtering systems for ionized physical vapor deposition ({IPVD}) is reviewed. The application of a secondary discharge, inductively coupled plasma magnetron sputtering ({ICP}-{MS}) and microwave amplified magnetron sputtering, is discussed as well as the high power impulse magnetron sputtering ({HIPIMS}), the self-sustained sputtering ({SSS}) magnetron, and the hollow cathode magnetron ({HCM}) sputtering discharges. Furthermore, filtered arc-deposition is discussed due to its importance as an {IPVD} technique. Examples of the importance of the {IPVD}-techniques for growth of thin films with improved adhesion, improved microstructures, improved coverage of complex shaped substrates, and increased reactivity with higher deposition rate in reactive processes are reviewed.},

The market is now estimated to be at least double that of a mere seven years ago when the first edition of this book was published. The second edition is an update with a considerably expanded and revised scope. Plasma {CVD} and metallo-organic {CVD} are two major factors in this rapid growth. Readers will find the latest data on both processes in this volume. Likewise, the book explains the growing importance of {CVD} in production of semiconductor and related applications.},

	abstract = {{ELSEVIER} {SALE} - {ALL} {SCIENCE} {AND} {TECHNOLOGY} {BOOKS} 50\% {OFF} - {ONE} {WEEK} {ONLYThis} updated version of the popular handbook further explains all aspects of physical vapor deposition ({PVD}) process technology from the characterizing and preparing the substrate material, through deposition processing and film characterization, to post-deposition processing. The emphasis of the new edition remains on the aspects of the process flow that are critical to economical deposition of films that can meet the required performance specifications, with additional information to support the original material.  The book covers subjects seldom treated in the literature: substrate characterization, adhesion, cleaning and the processing. The book also covers the widely discussed subjects of vacuum technology and the fundamentals of individual deposition processes. However, the author uniquely relates these topics to the practical issues that arise in {PVD} processing, such as contamination control and film growth effects, which are also rarely discussed in the literature. In bringing these subjects together in one book, the reader can understand the interrelationship between various aspects of the film deposition processing and the resulting film properties. The author draws upon his long experience with developing {PVD} processes and troubleshooting the processes in the manufacturing environment, to provide useful hints for not only avoiding problems, but also for solving problems when they arise. He uses actual experiences, called \&quot;war stories\&quot;, to emphasize certain points. Special formatting of the text allows a reader who is already knowledgeable in the subject to scan through a section and find discussions that are of particular interest. The author has tried to make the subject index as useful as possible so that the reader can rapidly go to sections of particular interest. Extensive references allow the reader to pursue subjects in greater detail if desired.   The book is intended to be both an introduction for those who are new to the field and a valuable resource to those already in the field. The discussion of transferring technology between R\&amp;D and manufacturing provided in Appendix 1, will be of special interest to the manager or engineer responsible for moving a {PVD} product and process from R\&amp;D into production. Appendix 2 has an extensive listing of periodical publications and professional societies that relate to {PVD} processing. The extensive Glossary of Terms and Acronyms provided in Appendix 3 will be of particular use to students and to those not fully conversant with the terminology of {PVD} processing or with the English language.Fully revised and updated to include the latest developments in {PVD} process technology‘War stories’ drawn from the author’s extensive experience emphasize important points in development and {manufacturingAppendices} include listings of periodicals and professional societies, terms and acronyms, and material on transferring technology between R\&amp;D and manufacturing},

	abstract = {Behaviors of nickel and gold clusters deposited onto a vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotube film ({VA}-{SWCNT}) were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation methods. Brenner potential was applied for carbon–carbon, and bond-order potential was applied for metal–metal and carbon–metal interactions. Their parameters of gold–gold and carbon–gold were derived by density functional theory calculations. After metal clusters were fully annealed, they were deposited onto the flat nanotube surface with small evaporation energy. Nickel clusters spread over the surface; on the other hand, the gold clusters sometimes formed a grain-like structure, especially when they formed a large cluster before arriving at the surface. When another {CNT} was placed on the vertically aligned surface, nickel clusters spread and formed a smooth surface, as in the case of a {VA}-{SWCNT} film; however, gold clusters could not spread but formed a grain-like structure. This result is in good agreement with the experimental and indicates the mechanism for forming a grain-like structure on a {VA}-{SWCNT}. To avoid the formation of a grain-like structure on the surface of a {SWCNT}, the deposition should be carried out under a high vacuum condition and at a low deposition rate for preventing clustering as it obstructs formation of a flat surface.},

We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations on a massively parallel computer to model the Aun → Au system. The results suggest that both collisional and thermal spike mechanisms contribute to the large nonlinear yields observed by Andersen et al. Our simulations also indicate that sputtering statistics are very important at high cluster bombarding energies. A substantial fraction of the simulated impacts produce no sputtered atoms, while individual sputtering events producing very large numbers of sputtered atoms contribute significantly to the total sputtering yield at high energy.},

	abstract = {{CHARMM} (Chemistry at {HARvard} Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The {CHARMM} program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with {CHARMM} can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original {CHARMM} article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the {nCUBE} 2, Intel {iPSC}/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-{MP} and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

The {GROMACS} software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel {MD} and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in {ANSI} C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the {GROMOS} ({GROningen} {MOlecular} Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; {BIOMOS} B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 {AG} Groningen). Conversion programs between {GROMOS} and {GROMACS} formats are included.

The {MD} program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},
